# Enclosure for Raspberry PI

This enclosure is designed to be sleek and minimalistic. It is designed to be 3D printed. This case does not provide any camera or display port access. But GPIO are easily accessibles.

## Compatibility
This enclosure support following boards:

* Raspberry PI 1B+
* Raspberry PI 2B
* Raspberry PI 2B 1.2
* Raspberry PI 3B
* Raspberry PI 3B+

## Thermal management
This enclosure is designed to be used with passive cooling solution. 35x35x12mm heatsink is recommended. Can be easily modified to fit 40x40x12mm heatsink.

A 1mm copper plate between the CPU and the heatsink is needed to allow space for surrounding components.

No need for fan event with intense CPU usage.

## Material and print settings
Clearance is 0.2mm for all parts to facilitate assembly. No support is needed.

4x M3x24mm flat-head screws and 4x M3 nuts are needed to assemble the case.

## Run button
1mm hole above jack connector is designed to fit a 6x6mm push button. This button can be used to wake the Raspberry PI.
